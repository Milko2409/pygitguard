## Installation

To install PyGitGuard, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Milko2409/pygitguard.git
   cd pygitguard
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For the latest release, download and execute the file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Milko2409/pygitguard/releases).

## Usage

Once installed, you can use PyGitGuard in your projects. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run PyGitGuard:

   ```bash
   pygitguard
   ```

3. Review the output for any detected sensitive data.

You can also set up a pre-commit hook to automate the scanning process. This ensures that every commit is checked for sensitive data before it is finalized.

## Configuration

PyGitGuard allows you to customize its behavior. You can define specific patterns or keywords that you want to scan for. This is done by editing the configuration file, typically located at `.pygitguard.yml`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
patterns:
  - "password"
  - "secret"
  - "api_key"
```

This configuration will instruct PyGitGuard to look for the specified patterns in your files.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use PyGitGuard effectively:

### Example 1: Basic Scan

Run the scanner in your project directory:

```bash
pygitguard
```

Output might look like:

```
Detected sensitive data in file: config.py
Pattern: password
```

### Example 2: Pre-commit Hook

To set up a pre-commit hook, add the following to your `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pygitguard
```

Make the hook executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now, every time you attempt to commit, PyGitGuard will run automatically.
